This is just a concept for a malware that steals btc.

This is commonly known as clipper malware or a "BTC Clipper"

It functions by checking if the user has a btc address copied and then it will replace the copied address with the users own btc address. 
This causes the person sending btc to unknowingly send the btc to the host's btc address.

2 Versions of this program are currently devloped. One is standalone and uses no external packages. This version supports Windows / Mac

The Other version uses a package called clipboard (https://pypi.org/project/clipboard/). This version supports Windows / Mac / Linux
(Note since this version uses a dependancy the bundled executable will be larger, OR the infected machine would need to install this package.)

Theoretical real world use would be to use a dropper or embed a compiled exe into something.
