# BTCMalware
A simple example for a Multi-OS BTC malware that exploits the clipboard using Python 3


This is just a concept for a malware for stealing btc.

This is commonly known as clipper malware or a "BTC Clipper"

It functions by checking if the user has a btc address copied and then it will replace the copied address with the users own btc address. 
This causes the person sending btc to unknowingly send the btc to the host's btc address.
